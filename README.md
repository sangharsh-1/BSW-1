# A Birthday Surprise Web App

This is a multi-page, interactive, and emotional birthday website created as a surprise for a friend. It features a soothing, cinematic theme with anime-style backgrounds, lo-fi ambience, and a dynamic "Memory Wall" where friends can leave messages and photos.

## Features

- **Interactive Pages**: Multiple themed pages including a landing page, a memory wall, and a final video surprise.
- **Photo Memories**: Users can upload a photo and a message to share on the Memory Wall.
- **Local Storage**: The Memory Wall's data is saved directly in your web browser's local storage, meaning your memories persist between visits and the app works entirely offline.
- **Editable "About Me" Page**: A fun, doodle-themed page with content that can be edited and saved directly in the browser.
- **Recovery "Game"**: A terminal-based minigame to "recover" a lost wish and unlock the final page.
- **Dynamic & Themed UI**: Features animated backgrounds, custom fonts, and a responsive design that adapts to different pages.
